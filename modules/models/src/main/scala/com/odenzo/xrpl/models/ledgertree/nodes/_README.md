# Ledger Nodes

APIs (e.g. LedgerData) can be used to get LedgerNodes and traverse the ledger tree.

More or less returning a list of LedgerNodes of various types, which have points (Hash) to other Ledger nodes.

These should be elaborated but a little bit on the lower priority until I play with CLIO to see if it can
completely replace.
