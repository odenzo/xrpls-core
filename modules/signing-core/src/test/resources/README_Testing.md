# Testing Readme

Currently there are a few modes of testing:

* Fixtures taken from the Javascript library
* Fixtures generated by sending transactions to TestNet or Local TestNet
* Fine Grain unit tests for Serialization
* Fine Grain unit tests for Signing

All these can operate "stand-alone".


Currently separating out testing, and alot of duplicated overlap.
