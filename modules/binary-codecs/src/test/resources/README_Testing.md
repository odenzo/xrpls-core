# Testing Readme

Currently there are a few modes of testing all of which require no infrastructure/network support.

##Fixtures that are used to get good coverage

* Fixtures taken from the Ripple Javascript library
* Fixtures generated by sending transactions to TestNet or Local TestNet (and saved)


## Some psuedo-unit  / dev tests


* Fine Grain unit tests for Serialization
* Fine Grain unit tests for Signing

All these can operate "stand-alone" too.
